After finalising and submitting my proposal I wanted to get straight into creating my game for the FYP, I started by setting up a HackNPlan for my project and creating the tasks that I want to get done during the first week.

This is what I proceed with for the first week. If I manage to get everything done early I can get new tasks using the Gantt chart I made for my project proposal as inspiration.

I plan on posting these updates weekly to review my work.
